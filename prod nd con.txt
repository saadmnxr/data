Producer consumer problem is a synchronization problem. There is a fixed size buffer
where the producer produces items and that is consumed by a consumer process. One
solution to the producer consumer problem uses shared memory. To allow producer and
consumer processes to run concurrently, there must be available a buffer of items that can
be filled by the producer and emptied by the consumer. This buffer will reside in a region of
memory that is shared by the producer and consumer processes. The producer and
consumer must be synchronized, so that the consumer does not try to consume an item that
has not yet been produced.

choice=0; in = 0;

printf(“\n1. Produce \t 2. Consume \t3. Exit”);

{
 case 1: if((in+1)%bufsize==out)
 printf(“\nBuffer is Full”);
