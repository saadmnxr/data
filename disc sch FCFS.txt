FCFS is the simplest of all the Disk Scheduling Algorithms. In FCFS, the requests are
addressed in the order they arrive in the disk queue.
Algorithm:
1. Let Request array represents an array storing indexes of tracks that have been requested
in ascending order of their time of arrival. ‘head’ is the position of disk head.
2. Let us one by one take the tracks in default order and calculate the absolute distance of
the track from the head.
3. Increment the total seek count with this distance.
4. Currently serviced track position now becomes the new head position.
5. Go to step 2 until all tracks in request array have not been serviced.

TotalHeadMoment=TotalHeadMoment+abs(RQ[i]-initial);
